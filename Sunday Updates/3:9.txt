Sunday Update

This week I spent time on the following items.

(1)
I worked on modeling the death/nodeath indicator.  I have a logistic
regression that seems to do a decent job, as well as a K nearest
neighbors.  They seem to predict at similar rates, and I plan on
including both in the midterm submission.

(2)
I tried to model the counts of deaths in each conflict.  This was
harder.  Poisson regression predicts terribly, as does OLS on the log
of the number of deaths (which I tried to bring in the distribution a
bit).  Christing suggested that I tried a decision tree, which I have
implemented as well.  It is better than either of other the two models, but
it still does not do a good job predicting.  The answer to this
question is that maybe there are other things driving the exact number
of deaths that my dataset does not capture.

(3)
I made a great (at least, I think it's great) map graphic illustrating
the locations of some of these conflicts.  This graphic is thanks to
Christine's suggestion.

(4)
I wrote captions for all of my figures and tables, readying my work
for midterm.


Goals for the upcoming week:
This is the last work week before midterm!  I want to continue working
on my model for the number of deaths, but by Wednesday or so I want to
be done with work and spend time tidying up my code and making
slides.  The modeling section of my code needs some explanations and
some work done to describe my process.  Then I'm good for
midterm and my presentation.
