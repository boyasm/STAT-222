Sunday Update

This week I spent time on the following items.

(1)
I merged three additional datasets into my main datset from a variety
of locations.  Two of them were easy 1:1 merges, while the third
required a bit of manipulation before the merge could take place.

(2)
I decided to exclude multi-year conflicts for the time being to make
the merge easier because everything else is measured on a yearly level.

(3)
I continued making the figures and tables as specified in my research
proposal.  I adjusted some of the plots slightly from my original
descriptions as I started to work with the data and discovered that my
original ideas created useless plots.  Most of the basic summary
figures and tables are now complete.

(4)
I have started working on some generic code to split my dataset into
training and testing sets, something that will become useful next
week.  Which leads me to the following...


Goals for the upcoming week:
Next week is regression week!  I have most everything set to go for that,
and it's time to start building some models and seeing what happens.
Then I just need to create a presentation and organize my work, and I
will be all set for the midterm requirements.
