Sunday Update

This week I spent time on the following items.

(1)
Unfortunately, I made some errors in what I did last week, so I had to
redo some of the code to code certain observations as missings.

(2)
I removed duplicate rows in my core dataset according to the
documentation provided online.

(3)
I began the process of making figures for my final paper,
experimenting with Matplotlib.  I chose a color palette
for my paper (one that should be both accomodating to colorblind
people as well as printing the paper on a greyscale printer). One plot
is finalized (with some help from Victoria with regards to axis
numbers), and other plots are in varying stages of completion.

(4)
I ran some preliminary correlations between variables in my dataset to
see if the data behaves the way I might expect it to.  The short
answer to that exercise is that there weren't any real surprises.  I
think, therefore, that I now have a decent-enough handle on my data to
begin building some models.



Goals for the upcoming week:
(1)
Continue making figures and tables.

(2)
Start running regressions

(3)
Begin the process of merging in external datasets with more variables
