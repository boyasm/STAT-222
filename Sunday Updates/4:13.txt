Sunday Update
 
This week I spent time on the following items.
 
(1)
I created my test suite as a separate iPython Notebook that generates a .py
file to be run using nosetests in the Terminal.  I have 13 tests, all of which
run correctly.  Since I was unable to reference code cells in another iPython
notebook, I copied the code from my main notebook into my testing
notebook at Victoria's suggestion.
 
(2)
In the process of writing the test suite, I discovered a potential bug in one of
my sets of code to merge two datasets.  The output of my original code ended
up being correct, but it was correct by chance, and future versions of the datasets
could potentially result in errors.  I patched that potential bug.  Results are exactly
the same as before, but now the code is more robust.
 
(3)
I continued the planning phases of my final paper, and I plan on getting
a draft written by the end of this coming week/beginning of the following week.
That way I have over two weeks to edit and polish before the deadline.
