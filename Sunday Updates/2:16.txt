Sunday Update

This week I spent time on the following items.

(1)
I spent a good portion of the beginning of the week working with the
Python materials from class, trying to attain a comfortable working
knowledge of the language to allow me to proceed with the project.

(2)
I made revisions to my project proposal for resubmission this coming
Wednesday, February 19.

(3)
I completed the research phase of my literature review.

(4)
I continued experimenting with iPython and the pandas library, using
Wes McKinney's book as a supplement to the introduction that we
received in class.  I reworked and simplified my code from last week
that created the indicator variable, and I recoded all missing values
in my main dataset as the NumPy NaN character.  I also ran some very
preliminary correlation analyses (mainly to see if I could actually run them in Python).

Goals for the upcoming week:
I plan on using this coming week to make a significant amount of
progress on my project.  I would like to run some more comprehensive
preliminary analyses, and I would like to begin the creation of some
of the graphs and diagrams that I outlined in my proposal.  Hopefully
at the end of the week, I will have enough of an idea about how my
dataset behaves to begin running regressions and exploring models.
