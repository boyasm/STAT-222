Sunday Update
 
This week I spent time on the following items.
 
(1)
I finalized my logistic regression process and created a KNN model.
 
(2)
I worked a bit on my Poisson regression, creating a variable selection
process and a model.  I also extended the model and compared it to a
CART decision tree and a KNN.
 
(3)
I finalized my tables and figures.
 
(4)
I have a presentation ready to go for tomorrow morning.
