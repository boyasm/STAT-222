Hi Victoria,

I have uploaded two versions of my midterm report.  One (Boyas_MidtermReport_Captions) has captions underneath the figures/tables in the slides.  The other (Boyas_MidtermReport_NoCaptions) has the slides saved at full size and is included in case you would like to see the figures/tables larger than in the version with captions.  Other than that, they are the same.

Thanks very much, and have a great break.

Best,
Matt
